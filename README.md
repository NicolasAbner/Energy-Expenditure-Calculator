# Energy-Expenditure-Calculator
A projetc Developed for a Conclusion Course Subject at College.
The objective for this project is to help user in general to calculate the waste of energy of some equipment that waste the most at home. 
This way, the user will inform his waste target, in kwH, where did the user live - to calculate with the right energy rate - how much energy did the equipment require, and how many the user have at home. 
It will generate a report about the total waste of the equipaments and how much the user need to save to fit in his spending target.
There will be updates in the future to implement the aplication!

- Thanks, Nicolas Abner.
